## Steps

   - Install webpack globally: `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli`
   - Run `npm install` in this directory to install dependencies (i.e. http-server)
   - run `npm start` to start the webserver
   - visit http://localhost:8080
   - run `webpack` to generate a defaul bundle.js. It is saved in /dist.
   - reload the webpage. It should show a list with numbers 1-10
   - Look at - and update - index.js to change the code
   - don't forget to re-run `webpack`!
