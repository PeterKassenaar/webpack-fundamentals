    <h1>40 - Webpack using SCSS</h1>
    <p>We have a general `theme.scss` with some basic variables.</p>
    <p>We have an `index.scss` that imports the theme.scess.</p>
    <p>Also installed are `node-sass` and `sass-loader`.</p>
    <p>
        See the `webpack.config.js` file for a demonstration of chaining of sass-loader with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't forget to `npm install` the needed loaders first!
